# Keybindings
- why don't counts work
- equivalent of old extensions captureChar thing for e.g. split by char command
- sometimes things leave me in the wrong select_on state, haven't paid enough attention to what specifically though
- make shift+l match shift+h behavior of alternating between including and excluding whitespace

# Extension
- better visual distinction between modes
- the first time I inserted my keybindings it did it wrong and created a new array next to the existing one and also the opening bracket was commented out

 # Other
- visual distinction for primary vs. secondary selections
