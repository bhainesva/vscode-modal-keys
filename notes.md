Current issues I'm working on:

1. why does failed validation for `allowed_prefixs` (e.g. using `<all=prefixes>` instead of `<all-prefixes>`) silently fail

2. `larkin.toml` we need to make it so that moving around preserves the selection if it
  is already enabled (e.g. by checking if there is a selection)

3. start implementing various commands to make more keybindings work

4. figure out how to enable additional extensions
