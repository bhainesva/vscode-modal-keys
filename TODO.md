# Keybindings

- why don't counts work
- why does 'e' only select words sometimes
- equivalent of old extensions captureChar thing for e.g. split by char command
- sometimes things leave me in the wrong select_on state, haven't paid enough attention to what specifically though



# Extension
 - better visual distinction between modes
 - the first time I inserted my keybindings it did it wrong and created a new array next to the existing one and also the opening bracket was commented out
