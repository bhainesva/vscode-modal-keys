## Developer Notes

This repo relies on a working version of `nvm` installed in bash and a npm version matching
the version specified in `.nvmrc`. You can satisfy this requirement by copying and running the
following in bash.

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash # install nvm
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # load nvm
nvm install # install npm version found in `.nvmrc`
```

You can then install all dependencies for this project as normal:

```sh
nvm use
npm i
```
